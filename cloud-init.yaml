# Install additional packages on first boot
#
# Default: none
#
# if packages are specified, then package_update will be set to true
#
# packages may be supplied as a single package name or as a list
# with the format [<package>, <version>] wherein the specific
# package version will be installed.
packages:
 - postgresql

# run commands
# default: none
# runcmd contains a list of either lists or a string
# each item will be executed in order at rc.local like level with
# output to the console
# - runcmd only runs during the first boot
# - if the item is a list, the items will be properly executed as if
#   passed to execve(3) (with the first arg as the command).
# - if the item is a string, it will be simply written to the file and
#   will be interpreted by 'sh'
#
# Note, that the list has to be proper yaml, so you have to quote
# any characters yaml would eat (':' can be problematic)
runcmd:
 - sudo -u postgres psql template1 -c "ALTER USER postgres with encrypted password 'password';"
 - echo port=5450 | sudo tee /etc/postgresql/14/main/conf.d/datetify.conf
